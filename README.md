# Server-Side Web Programming (CS 174)

This is the final project I submitted for the web programming course I took in Spring 2022. 

This simple web-based application tests my knowledge on the material I learned in the course which includes:
    - PHP
    - basic HTML
    - JavaScript
    - MySQL
    - database access
    - sessions
    - cookies 

The application itself is a recipe listing app. When you select from a list of ingredients, recipes which include those indgredients will be listed. Users are able to create and sign in to a personal account where they can save and view their favorite recipes.
